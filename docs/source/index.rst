ScotchWSGI - Yet Another Web Server
===================================

ScotchWSGI is a `WSGI-compliant <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/>`_ web server written in Python.
Driven by the `gevent <http://www.gevent.org/>`_ library, it is able to handle tens of thousands of open connections at once.
It currently implements the majority of `HTTP/1.1 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616>`_ features, and work is underway to support `HTTP/2.0 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540>`_.

*Note: This is primarily an educational side project undertaken to explore the specifications of the web and how modern web servers work. While ScotchWSGI aims to be a stable project, it should be viewed as an experimental web server and should not be used in production.*
